Inn
//It's a largish room housing several tables and chairs. Since we probably won't be doing multiple times for this there will always be 
//people here regardless of how early it is

NPCs -
  Innkeep
    Description - a desheveled but attentive man. He's kind and helpful to the residents of the town and to you.
    
    Talk - When you first enter this area he will talk to you first without prompts. He explains that someone found you outside the caves looking like
          you had crawled your way out of them and brought you in to rest up. He asks you what happened and you realize that the only thing that you 
          can remember is your name. He feels sorry for you and gives you the room until you can figure out who you are as long as you can help out around
          town. He also gives you a free beer in your inventory.
         - After that you can talk to him for flavor and order more drinks or food for money. He's helpful and will tell you what he knows which isn't much about
       the cave but he does know about the town and people if applicable.   
  
  Drunk Regular
    Description - a woman who has had too much to drink. She's gruff and has a few knives barely conceled. She's being watched over by a friend
    
    Talk - She isn't too responsive but when prodded will pull out a knife somewhat unthreateningly. Her friend will take the knife away from her.
   
  Friend of Drunk Regular
    Description - A younger, woman with a bit of a gut. She's a kind, if ineffective friend to the regular.
    
    Talk - She'll give you her name and apologize for her friend of whom she has no power over her tendency to drink herself into oblivion. Aparently her friend
    does this about once a week and then she'll be fine. The barkeeper will confirm this. Maybe she laments that her friend's hangovers are intolerable
    and she has a quest where if you bring her a potion that cures hangover or poison or something that she'll give you a good item. Maybe a few of her
    friend's throwing knives to use in battle as single use high damage items.
    
  Old Man at Table
    Description - A silent old man quietly drinking. He looks uninterested and a bit stand-offish
    
    Talk - This is the NPC that knows the most about the dungeon. He traveled the cave a long time back and and though he never seemed to reach the end he
    can give info. He won't give it out at first you have to do something for him. Maybe you have to enter the dungeon first before he tells you or get
    him something. Maybe you have to get your stuff from halfway through the dungeon and then he'll tell you the full tale.
    He'll tell you that the dungeon has been put under a curse from a demon long since killed by an ancient hero. If you have your stuff he'll tell you
    that your sword reminds him of that hero's blade. The dungeon won't go away until the spirit of the demon is banished once more by a magic blade along
    with some other macguffin.
