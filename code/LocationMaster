 * Call this class from main at the beginning of the game to instantiate all the locations and their data.
 * Store in the constructor function all the locations you want to create, and put the data in LocationConstructor. 
 * This is tightly coupled if you see it as separate classes, but I think of it as one big class that has three pages
 * to allow for shorter classes and to have a more intuitive interface.
