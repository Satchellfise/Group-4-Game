Final-Quest or whatever the hell we're calling it. Everything goes in here I guess

The game is a text-based adventure with a turn-based battle system
It takes place in part in the town where the player will have to go around and search for items to help them get through the dungeon
Once they reach the dungeon, they can explore a series of semi-random rooms and monsters to reach the end.

There are multiple endings but only one true ending in beating the dungeon.
